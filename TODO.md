# Performance Optimization TODO

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Analyze codebase for performance issues (LCP 5.52s, CLS 0.86, INP needs interaction)
- [x] Add width and height attributes to all <img> tags to prevent CLS
- [x] Preload critical images (logo, first carousel slide) in index.html
- [x] Convert images to WebP format for better compression
- [x] Ensure lazy loading for below-fold images (already in OurWork, ProjectDetail)
- [x] Test performance after changes (server running, HTML includes preloads)

## Pending Tasks
- [ ] Optimize font loading if needed
- [ ] Add interactions for INP measurement
